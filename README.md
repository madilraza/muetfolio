## Deployment 📦 
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Deploying to Github Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on Github pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://developerfolio.js.org/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/developerFolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`. 

- In short you can also add `/devloperFolio` to `package.json` as both are exactly same. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly. 

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

#### Deploying to Netlify

You could also host directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.
